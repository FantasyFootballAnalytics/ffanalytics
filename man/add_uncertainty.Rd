\title{Add uncertainty to the table}
\usage{
add_uncertainty(projection_table)
}
\description{
Calculation of uncertainty is done by scaling the standard deviation
variables, averaging them, and then creating a within-position percentile
rank ranging from 1 to 99. A score of 1 indicates there is very little
uncertainty (low standard deviation) and a score of 99 indicates there is
a large degree of uncertainty
}
\details{
A low score means there is general agreement among experts and projections.
A high score indicates there is a lot of variability in rankings and/or
projections. By default `add_uncertainty()` uses `sd_pts` and `sd_ecr` to
compute uncertantity.
