\usage{
custom_scoring(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{this can be indivdual scoring variables or a list of scoring variables
for specific positions. The list will need to be named with a separated list of
positions. Note that scoring for passing, kicking, and dst should never be specified
within a list.}
}
\description{
This function geerates a list of scoring settings that can be used as custom
scoring setting for calculations. THe resulting list will still need to have
a \code{pts_bracket} element added to handle points allowed for DSTs. See
\code{vignette("scoring_settings")} about this.

# Settings for a standard league:
custom_scoring(pass_yds = 0.04, pass_tds = 4,
               rush_yds = 0.1, rush_tds = 6,
               rec_yds = 0.1, rec_tds = 6)

# Settings for a PPR league
custom_scoring(pass_yds = 0.04, pass_tds = 4,
               rush_yds = 0.1, rush_tds = 6,
               rec = 1, rec_yds = 0.1, rec_tds = 6)

# Settings for a PPR league with TE premium
custom_scoring(pass_yds = 0.04, pass_tds = 4,
               rush_yds = 0.1, rush_tds = 6,
               RB = list(rec = 0, rec_yds = 0.1, rec_tds = 6),
